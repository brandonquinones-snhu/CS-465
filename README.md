CS-465-12432-M01 Full Stack Development I 2025 C-1 (Jan - Mar)

In this project we created a MEAN application using MongoDb, Express, Angular, and Node.js

We used MongoDB as a NoSQL backend database becasue we needed a way to store documents and a way to edit them, using a JSON style docuement format was the best way to do this and MongoDB is a great way to store JSON documents. MongoDB also works seemlesly with JavaScript making it perfect for our project. 

The JSON docuemnts tied the front and back end very well because it was serves the ability to allow the front end to send requests and receive structured responses from the backend. For example, fetching a trip allows the front end to make a request by inlcuding the the trip code in the URL in which the backend will provide based on that front end request. 

Some of the testing methods used were integration testing and unit testing. When creating each functionality we first tested it on Postman to ensure the logic was correct. Once confirming that we were able to route and the necessary components to allow the front end to make the request. One example was when implementing the JWT security tokens for the users.

My reflection of this course is that full-stack development is heavily needed in applications where a full understand of the front and back end is required. When creating APIs we build with functionality, scalability, and efficiency in mind. Database management was also something I had previous experience using already but it was a new experince creating and connecting it to the font end. The end of the course had a focus on JWT as a security measure which I think was very necessary as when working with real-world applications there need to be security measures put in place.
